  "readme": "# xpath-builder\n\nA JavaScript DSL around a subset of XPath 1.0. Its primary purpose is to\nfacilitate writing complex XPath queries from JavaScript code.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/featurist/xpath-builder.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/featurist/xpath-builder)\n\nxpath-builder is a port of the [xpath](https://github.com/jnicklas/xpath) Ruby gem.\n\n\n## Generating expressions\n\nTo create quick, one-off expressions, create an xpath builder:\n\n```js\nx = require('xpath-builder').dsl();\n\nx.descendant('ul').where(x.attr('id').equals('foo'))\n```\n\nHowever for more complex expressions, it is probably more convenient to include\nthe builder object in your prototype chain:\n\n```js\nfunction MyXPaths() {}\n\nMyXPaths.prototype = require('xpath-builder').dsl();\n\nMyXPaths.prototype.fooList = function() {\n  return this.descendant('ul').where(this.attr('id').equals('foo'));\n};\n\nMyXPaths.prototype.passwordField = function(id) {\n  return this.descendant('input')\n             .where(this.attr('type').equals('password'))\n             .where(this.attr('id').equals(id));\n};\n```\n\nBoth ways return an\n[`Expression`](./src/expression.pogo)\ninstance, which can be further modified.  To convert the expression to a\nstring, just call `.toString()` on it. All available expressions are defined in\n[`DSL`](./src/dsl.pogo).\n\n## Strings and Literals\n\nWhen you send a string as an argument to any xpath-builder function, it may be interepreted as a string literal, or an xpath literal, depending on the function:\n\n```js\nx.descendant('p').where(x.attr('id').equals('foo'))\n```\n\nWhich generates:\n\n```\n.//p[./@id = 'foo']\n```\n\nOccasionally you might want XPath literals instead of string literals, in which case wrap your string in a call to .literal():\n\n```js\nx.descendant('p').where(x.attr('id').equals(x.literal('foo')))\n```\n\nWhich generates:\n\n```\n.//p[./@id = foo]\n```\n\nThis expression would match any p tag whose id attribute matches a 'foo' tag it contains. Most of the time, this is not what you want.\n\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright © 2013 Josh Chisholm\n\nCopyright © 2010 Jonas Nicklas\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the ‘Software’), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ‘AS IS’, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
